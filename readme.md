The second file is to used to knowledge to try out something by retrieving all Disney movies shown from Wikipedia to a list and the code is stored in __disney_wiki.py__. 

## Week 2, Week 3
The third file __selenium_practice.py__ is used to download images from the official premier league website which I attempt to used it to classify the pictures according to their 20 teams.  
__premier_league_data.py__ is used to extract data into dataframe.

Article titles has been extracted and __topic_modeling.py__ has been added to classify the topic within the titles but there are plenty of room for an improvement.
